# Learning Raspberry Pi
This repository documents my projects, notes, and experiments as I learn and build Raspberry Pi (and electronics, robotics, Internet-of-Things, etc.). It's a space for me to save my ideas, track my progress, and save my work. Iâ€™m sharing my progress on X at [@mmlouamri](https://x.com/mmlouamri). Follow me to stay updated, or drop me a DM if you have suggestions!

The `projects/` folder contains hands-on projects, including Python code, KiCAD schematics, and implementation details. The `notes/` folder has notes and theoretical learnings related to electronics, IoT, robotics, and related topics (most are from ChatGPT). `notes/IDEAS.md` ([here](tree/main/notes/IDEAS.md)) has a list of project ideas and `notes/DONE.md` ([here](tree/main/notes/IDEAS.md)) has a list of completed ideas with links to their project directories.
